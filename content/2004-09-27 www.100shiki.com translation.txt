I have just found an amazing site. Jeremy, who works in technology in
London, has created something entirely new, a Tiddlywiki.

Using this, you can create wikis quite easily for using keyword links to
edit/view sites. I tried it myself, and Japanese also works great. Isn't
this a great application for taking personal memos and the like? 

And you will know if you actually use it, but it uses Web technology
with a good sense, and it provides an elegant interface. 
Moreover, it is quite amazing that the system is comprised of a single
HTML file. 

To use this system on your own, simply edit the TiddlyWiki on your own
and click the Save All link on the top right, and follow the subsequent
instructions to create your own Wiki page. 

In the past, to create a Wiki, one had to deal with cumbersome
installations, but with this, all you maintain is a single file.

Maintaining a single file only, is a great system; I hope it's extended
to others. 

After editing: This is good. 

For people who don't have a server, you can create it locally as a memo
application. 

The sample site I created is below.

Try it out! 

It may be good to write novels and manuals with this system.
