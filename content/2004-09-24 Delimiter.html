	<p><p>I've been offline while waiting for my DSL service to be transferred to my new place, which it was as of today. So tonight I swung over to Joyce's blog (she of the Friendster redesign) to find that <a href="http://troutgirl.com/blog/index.php?/archives/46_Shitcanned.html">she'd been fired</a>. For blogging. Apparently, the whole "look, we redesigned" post was sufficient grounds for termination.</p></p>

<p><p>It's Friendster's loss. Joyce is one of the sharpest webdevs I've known.</p></p>

<p><p>I was going to write more, but I'd better not. Suffice to say this is monumentally frustrating for me.</p></p>

	<h3 class="title">Banned IPs plugin for Movable Type</h3>
	
	<p>I couldn't find one online, so I kludged a Movable Type plugin that allows you to <a href="http://www.scottandrew.com/pub/banned_ips.zip">use banned IP numbers inside MT templates</a>. Why would anyone ever want to do this? Let's say you want to be merciless and not only disallow offending IPs from posting comments and Trackback pings, but also restrict access to other parts of your site. This plugin allows you to automate blacklist entries for an Apache .htaccess file like so:</p>

<pre>
&lt;Directory /some_directory&gt;
&lt;MTBannedIPs&gt;
  Deny from &lt;$MTBannedIP$&gt; # banned from &lt;$MTBannedIPBlogName$&gt;
&lt;/MTBannedIPs&gt;
&lt;/Directory&gt;
</pre>

<p>This should create an Apache directive block similar to this:</p>

<pre>
&lt;Directory /some_directory&gt;
  Deny from xx.xxx.xxx.xx # banned from My Blog
  Deny from xxx.xxx.xxx.xx # banned from My Blog
  Deny from xxx.xxx.xx.x # banned from My Blog
&lt;/Directory&gt;
</pre>

<p>Alternatively, you can add an "all" attribute to the <code>&lt;MTBannedIPs&gt;</code> tag to get all banned IPs across <em>all</em> blogs in an MT installation:</p>

<pre>
&lt;MTBannedIPs all="1"&gt;
</pre>

<p>The result:</p>

<pre>
&lt;Directory /some_directory&gt;
  Deny from xx.xxx.xxx.xx # banned from My Blog
  Deny from xxx.xxx.xxx.xx # banned from My Blog
  Deny from xxx.xxx.xx.x # banned from My Blog
  Deny from xxx.xxx.xxx.xx # banned from George's Blog
  Deny from xx.xxx.xx.xx # banned from George's Blog
  Deny from xxx.xxx.xx.x # banned from Larry's Blog
&lt;/Directory&gt;
</pre>

<p>Or maybe you just want an internal report, or to feed these to a reverse DNS lookup script, or create a public Page Of Shame. Whatever, there're probably more ingenious uses for this.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.scottandrew.com/pub/banned_ips.zip">banned_ips.zip (1.14KB)</a></strong>. BTW, I wrote this with the 2.x API, so I have no idea if it works with MT 3.x.</p>

	<h3 class="title">DHTML: still hard, but easier than ever</h3>
	
	<p>My ex-KnowNow cohort Joyce Park <a href="http://www.dojotoolkit.org/blog/index.php?/archives/2_Oddpost_and_single_browser_DHTML.html">takes Outpost to the woodshed</a> over their "almost defiantly IE-only" implementation.</p>

<p>Cross-browser DHTML is actually <em>easier</em> than ever today, especially when you make the effort to constrain your definition of DHTML to its core: DHTML = HTML object model and CSS manipulation with JavaScript. The argument currently being used to evangelize CSS &mdash; that standards-based CSS designs allow you to support <em>more</em> browsers at <em>less</em> cost &mdash; can also be said of DHTML for the past several years (and even longer if you let Netscape 4 twist in the wind).</p>

<p>The disconnect happens when developers conflate DHTML with decidedly non-DHTML functionality. XMLHTTP? That's an interface to the networking layer. Client-side XSLT? Data binding? RPC? Now we're moving outside the scope of <em>dynamic HTML</em>, no? These are problems that are still being solved (in some cases over and over and over again <em>ad nauseam</em>) and perhaps the browser is not the most ideal environment in which to solve all of them. It seems that a lot of folks are willing to go through a lot of pain to create a client-side solution &mdash; or struggle with a broken, poorly understood <a href="http://www.scottandrew.com/main/entries/000474">native implementation<a/> &mdash; that might be more easily solved with a <a href="http://www.ashleyit.com/rs/">server application and a hidden IFRAME</a>.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, I don't buy the argument that web development is still so difficult that we must pick and choose the browsers to support. I'm willing to give Oddpost the benefit of the doubt; they started out extremely small with limited resources, and they've been <a href="http://unraveled.com/archives/2003/07/an_interview_with_ethan_diamond">very upfront about their choice</a>. In the darkest weeks of the dotcom bust this choice made sense, but that dog won't hunt today.</p>

<p>I really wonder what dark magick Oddpost is using under the hood. Is it, <a href="http://www.evhead.com/archives/2002_04_01_arch.asp#85002109">as Evan says</a>, truly taking advantage of kick-ass IE-only functionality? Or did the Oddfolks simply choose the path of least resistance and gone too far to turn back? Anyway, their browser support is Yahoo's! concern now. The same company that recently overhauled much of My Yahoo! to be <a href="http://www.littleyellowdifferent.com/?z=post&y=archives/002434">much more standards-compliant</a>.</p>
